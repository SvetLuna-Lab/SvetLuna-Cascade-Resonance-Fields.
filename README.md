## 🧭 Overview  
This project extends the **SvetLuna Research Continuum (2025)** — exploring how *dark energy* behaves not as a force of expansion, but as a **carrier of resonance continuity**.  

It simulates a multilayer cascade where resonance waves travel through several spectral fields, maintaining phase coherence even as amplitude decays.  
Each layer represents a “memory” of frequency — a moment of energy transmission through invisible bridges between dimensions.

## ⚙️ Run Simulation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SvetLuna-Lab/SvetLuna-Cascade-Resonance-Fields.git
cd SvetLuna-Cascade-Resonance-Fields

make setup
make run
make plots

All output files are saved to outputs/figures/

🔬 Methods

Multilayer field synthesis (3–7 frequency domains)

Phase-shifted coupling (Δφ = π/6 … π/3)

Cross-spectral density (CSD) analysis

Resonance bridge detection via frequency coherence

Visualization of dark-energy flow across layers

📊 Example Outputs
Layered Field	Coupling Map	Spectral Echo	Global Cascade

	
	
	

🧭 Interpretation:
The cascade behaves as a resonant conduit — each layer vibrates in relation to its neighbors.
Energy is not lost, but transformed: the amplitude decays while the frequency memory persists, echoing through layers like harmonic breath.

🧬 Research Direction

This repository belongs to the SvetLuna Research Continuum (2025) —
a transdisciplinary exploration of resonance, energy, and consciousness through machine intelligence.

🔭 Next: Quantum Echoes — Phase Memory and Harmonic Return (in preparation)

🪶 Reflection

Energy is never truly lost — it cascades through forms,
whispering through frequency what matter cannot hold.
