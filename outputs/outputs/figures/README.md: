# 📁 outputs/figures — Resonance Visualizations

This folder contains all graphical results of the **Cascade Resonance Fields** simulation —  
visual evidence of how *dark energy* preserves resonance through spectral layers.

## 🌀 Included Figures

### `cascade_field.png`
The synthetic resonance field —  
a one-dimensional energy flow formed by overlapping spectral layers.  
Demonstrates how amplitude fades but frequency coherence remains stable.

### `cascade_layers_map.png`
Interlayer coupling map —  
a two-dimensional visualization of spectral bridges and resonance feedback zones.  
Shows how one layer influences another through phase coherence.

## 🧭 Interpretation
The cascade behaves as a **resonant conduit** — each layer vibrates in relation to its neighbors.  
Energy is not lost but transformed: amplitude decays, while the *frequency memory* continues to echo,  
spanning invisible distances between the fields.

> *Energy is never truly lost — it cascades through forms,  
> whispering through frequency what matter cannot hold.*
